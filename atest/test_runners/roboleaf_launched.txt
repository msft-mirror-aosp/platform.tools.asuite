# atest --roboleaf-mode configuration file.
#
# !!! BE VERY CAREFUL when you add modules into this list. Atest will read this from
# ToT, so a change to this file may cause someone's local test workflow to
# change immediately.
#
# This file contains the directory and names of Android.bp tests that should be
# ran by Bazel.
#
# To verify, add entries and run `atest --roboleaf-mode <test name>`
#
# Use the fully qualified Bazel label format: //path/to:module
#
# Say, if there's a test module named "foo_test" defined in a/b/Android.bp, and
# you want Atest to use bazel to build and test it, then add //a/b:foo_test in
# this file.
#
# Example:
#
# //packages/modules/adb:adbd_test
# //packages/modules/adb:adb_test
# //system/media/audio_utils/tests:biquad_filter_tests

//frameworks/base/api:merge_annotation_zips_test
//platform_testing/tests/example/jarhosttest:HelloWorldHostTest
//system/tools/sysprop:sysprop_test
