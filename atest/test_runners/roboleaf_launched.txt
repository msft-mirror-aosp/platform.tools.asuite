# atest --roboleaf-mode configuration file.
#
# !!! BE VERY CAREFUL when you add modules into this list. Atest will read this from
# ToT, so a change to this file may cause someone's local test workflow to
# change immediately.
#
# This file contains the directory and names of Android.bp tests that should be
# ran by Bazel.
#
# To verify, add entries and run `atest --roboleaf-mode <test name>`
#
# Use the fully qualified Bazel label format: //path/to:module
#
# Say, if there's a test module named "foo_test" defined in a/b/Android.bp, and
# you want Atest to use bazel to build and test it, then add //a/b:foo_test in
# this file.
#
# Example: //packages/modules/adb:adb_test
#
# You can run all tests in this list with:
#
#   $ b test $(cat tools/asuite/atest/test_runners/roboleaf_launched.txt | grep -v "#" | tr '\n' ' ')
