"""Aspects used to transform certain providers into a TradefedTestDependencyInfo.

Tradefed tests require a TradefedTestDependencyInfo provider that is not
usually returned by most rules. Instead of creating custom rules to adapt
build rule providers, we use Bazel aspects to convert the input rule's
provider into a suitable type.

See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/aspects.html#aspects
for more information on how aspects work.
